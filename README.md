# Inheritance

I have designed a project using "inheritance" classes in order to calculate the area and perimeter of Rectangle and Square on windows forms platform.
I created four function methods in base class called "GeometricShape" and inherited from derived classes called "Rectangle" and "Square" in order to calculate.
